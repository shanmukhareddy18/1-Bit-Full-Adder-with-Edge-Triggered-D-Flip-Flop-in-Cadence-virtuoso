The project effectively demonstrated the principles and practices of CMOS VLSI design through the implementation and integration of a 1-bit full adder and a D edge-triggered flip-flop 
using 90nm technology. By focusing on performance metrics such as power efficiency, timing accuracy, and area optimization, the design adhered to modern standards in digital circuit design. 
Moreover, the hands-on experience with professional simulation tools like NGSPICE and Cadence Virtuoso provided valuable insight into the real-world VLSI design process.
